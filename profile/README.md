## Welcome at Bereau Lab :wave:
We are a computational physics group interested in the understanding and development of multiscale modeling and machine learning methods for soft-condensed matter and biomolecules. Research activities include

- Multiscale modeling for computational discovery and high-throughput screening
- Impact of coarse-graining on chemical-space exploration
- Physics-inspired machine learning for molecular systems
